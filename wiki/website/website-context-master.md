# JVTO Website Implementation Master

Single reference for website implementation. Does not duplicate `output/website/HANDOFF.md` (route → output → schema map). This document consolidates what HANDOFF does not: the **working values**, **business logic rules**, **wording constraints**, and **schema requirements** that every page must apply.

**Always read HANDOFF.md for route → file mapping. Read this file for logic, rules, and verified values.**

## Section 1: Working Values Table

*Resolve these before generating any content. Values marked High-drift must be live-checked before schema generation. Values below were verified from SSOT files on 2026-06-01.*

### 1.1 Review Counts & Ratings

| Field | Canonical value | Source | Last verified | Drift risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `reviewCount` (Trustpilot) | **51** | trust-signals.md §Live Review Platforms | 2026-05-18 | **High** |
| `reviewCount` (Google Maps) | **123** | trust-signals.md §Live Review Platforms | 2026-05-26 (API) | **High** |
| `reviewCount` (TripAdvisor) | **21** | trust-signals.md §Live Review Platforms | 2026-05-12 (DB) | Medium |
| `reviewCount` (cross-platform total) | **195** | calculated: 51+123+21 | 2026-05-26 | **High** |
| `ratingValue` (Trustpilot — schema primary) | **4.8** | trust-signals.md §Schema Canonical Values | 2026-05-18 | Medium |
| `ratingValue` (Google Maps) | **4.9** | trust-signals.md §Live Review Platforms | 2026-05-26 | Medium |
| `ratingValue` (TripAdvisor) | **4.95** | trust-signals.md §Live Review Platforms | 2026-05-12 | Low |

> **Schema rule**: Use `ratingValue: 4.8` (Trustpilot — lowest single-platform, conservative) for all schema. Use `reviewCount: 51` on TouristTrip pages. Use `reviewCount: 195` on Organization schema.
> **Never interchangeable**: Trustpilot `4.8` ≠ Google `4.9` ≠ TripAdvisor `4.95`.

## Section 3: Business Logic Rules

*All conditional logic enforced across the website. Reference before writing or reviewing any page.*

### 3.1 Ijen Health Screening — Mandatory Rule

**Regulatory basis**: BBKSDA Surat Edaran SE.1658/KSA.9/2024 (cited as supporting authority, not a conditional trigger).

The screening is **not JVTO-imposed**. It is regulatory, and it is **mandatory for every guest**: JVTO **coordinates** the clinic workflow so guests can satisfy the BBKSDA requirement.

> **Canonical sentence** (adjudicated 2026-07-06, supersedes the 2026-07-05 conditional decision and SSOT §2_4 — see [[credentials/medical-screening]]): A health certificate is mandatory for every guest before Kawah Ijen crater entry, per BBKSDA SE.1658/KSA.9/2024.

**When to apply**: Any content mentioning Ijen health certificate, health check, or medical screening.

**Approved wording:**
- ✅ "A health certificate is mandatory for every guest before Kawah Ijen crater entry, per BBKSDA SE.1658/KSA.9/2024."
- ✅ "JVTO coordinates the mandatory clinic workflow under BBKSDA SE.1658/KSA.9/2024."
- ✅ "Health-certificate screening coordination is required for every Ijen guest."
- ✅ "Health screening is mandatory under BBKSDA SE.1658/KSA.9/2024, cited here as supporting authority."

**Forbidden wording** (adjudicated 2026-07-06):
- ❌ "Ijen access rules can require a recent local health certificate" (or any threshold-conditional framing — superseded 2026-07-06)
- ❌ "Required by JVTO" / "JVTO-imposed rule" (the rule is regulatory; BBKSDA sets it, JVTO coordinates)
- ❌ Any phrasing that reduces the requirement to a crater-state or access-rules trigger

**Ijen-relevant packages** (mandatory health screening applies):
- Surabaya origin: `ijen-2d1n`, `ijen-bromo-madakaripura-3d2n`, `bromo-madakaripura-ijen-3d2n`, `ijen-papuma-tumpak-sewu-bromo-4d3n`, `ijen-bromo-madakaripura-4d3n`, `tumpak-sewu-bromo-ijen-4d3n`, `ijen-papuma-tumpak-sewu-bromo-5d4n`, `ijen-bromo-madakaripura-malang-5d4n`, `ijen-papuma-tumpak-sewu-bromo-malang-6d5n`
- Bali origin: `bali/bromo-ijen-3d2n`, `bali/ijen-bromo-madakaripura-3d2n`, `bali/ijen-papuma-tumpak-sewu-bromo-4d3n`, `bali/ijen-papuma-tumpak-sewu-bromo-5d4n`
- **Not Ijen-relevant (no health rule)**: `bromo-1d1n`, `bromo-2d1n` — Bromo does NOT have a health-certificate requirement.

**Failure rule**: If a guest is assessed unfit, the climb is cancelled for that individual (not the group). Screening cost is non-refundable. Source: dr-ahmad-irwandanu.md.

**Screening process** (when applicable):
1. Nurse/doctor visits guest hotel evening before hike (Bondowoso / Banyuwangi area)
2. Vitals recorded: SpO2, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory history
3. QR-verified surat sehat issued by Dr. Ahmad Irwandanu SIP
4. Certificate presented at crater gate for BBKSDA QR verification
5. **No Valid QR Code = No Crater Zone Access**

---

### 3.2 Blue Fire — Conditional Language

**Trigger**: Any Ijen content mentioning blue fire or blue flames.

**Approved wording:**
- ✅ "Blue Fire is a natural phenomenon subject to weather and gas activity."
- ✅ "Blue fire visibility depends on gas activity and weather conditions — not guaranteed."

**Forbidden wording:**
- ❌ "Blue Fire guaranteed"
- ❌ "100% Blue Fire visible"

---

### 3.3 Cancellation & Travel Credit

> **Canonical wording**: JVTO does not issue cash refunds. ≥48h before Day 1 = 100% non-expiring Travel Credit. <48h = forfeited.

**48-hour cut-off** (local Indonesia time):
- ≥48h before Day 1 start: **100% of booking value converts to JVTO Travel Credit** — IDR-denominated, non-expiring, transferable with written confirmation.
- <48h before Day 1 start: **booking forfeited up to 100%**. Travel Credit and cash refunds are generally not provided.

**Force majeure** (volcanic activity, government closures, severe weather): JVTO may offer reasonable alternatives, Travel Credit for unused portion, or partial/full cash refund net of non-recoverable expenses.

**Ijen denied clearance**: If a guest is denied health clearance, affected components are non-refundable (costs are pre-committed).

**Amendment rule**: One free reschedule ≥48h before Day 1, subject to availability. Reschedules <48h not permitted.

**Approved wording:**
- ✅ "Cancel ≥48h before your tour date: your payment converts to non-expiring JVTO Travel Credit."
- ✅ "Cancel <48h: booking is forfeited. No Travel Credit."
- ✅ "JVTO does not issue cash refunds as a standard policy."

**Forbidden wording:**
- ❌ "Flexible cancellation available" (without the 48h threshold)
- ❌ "Full refund" (JVTO issues Travel Credit, not cash)

---

### 3.4 Ijen Monthly Closure (Rijik Program)

- **First Friday of every month**: TWA Kawah Ijen is closed **00:00–23:59 WIB** to ALL tourism and mining activities.
- **Purpose**: Ecosystem cleaning (100–150 kg waste removal from Paltuding to crater rim) + endemic Cemara Gunung tree planting.
- **Program established**: March 1, 2019.
- Additional closures may be issued by BBKSDA East Java based on volcanic conditions.
- JVTO schedules around the monthly closure — guests are not affected if booked through JVTO.
- For dynamic status: check `bbksdajatim.org`.

---

### 3.5 FOC (Free of Charge) Group Policy

| Paying pax threshold | FOC seats | Additional benefit |
|---|---|---|
| 18+ | 1 FOC | — |
| 35+ | 2 FOC | — |
| 50+ | 3 FOC | **+5% discount for entire group** |

- "Pax" = paying guests only (FOC seats not counted).

- Source: jvto-policy-pack-v6.md + operational-facts.md.

---

### 3.6 Vehicle & Crew Allocation (by group size)

| Group size | Vehicle | Crew |
|---|---|---|
| 2–3 guests | 1 × MPV (e.g., Toyota Avanza or similar) | 1 × driver-guide (English-speaking) + licensed local site guides |
| 4–9 guests | 1 × Toyota Hiace (or similar 16-seat minibus) | 1 × professional driver + 1 × escort guide + licensed local site guides |
| 10–11 guests | 1 × Toyota Hiace + 1 × MPV (seating + luggage) | 1 × professional driver + 1 × escort guide + licensed local site guides |

**Bromo jeep rule**: Private 4WD jeep — **max 4 guests per jeep** for comfort and safety. Multiple jeeps for larger groups.

- **Odd groups**: 1 room per 2 guests + 1 extra bed in one room
- **Max**: 2 guests per standard room (excluding designated extra bed)
- **Couple preference**: King bed on request
- **Non-couple sharing**: Twin beds on request

---

### 3.8 Police Escort — Approved Language

✅ "For large groups (typically around 18 guests or more), JVTO can coordinate an official traffic police escort on certain road segments, when approved by the relevant Traffic Police unit."

❌ "JVTO provides police escort" (without the conditional context and group size qualifier)

---

### 3.9 Booking Confirmation Rule

> **Canonical sentence**: Booking confirmed = (package selected) AND (payment ≥20% processed) AND (Official E-Voucher PDF issued). All three required.

A booking is confirmed ONLY when ALL three apply:
1. Package selected and pricing agreed
2. Required payment processed (minimum 20% deposit)
3. Official E-Voucher / Invoice (PDF) issued

Deposit rule: **20%** standard. If Day 1 is within 14 days: up to **100% full payment** may be required.

Balance payment deadlines:
- By card: no later than 5 days before Day 1
- By bank transfer / Wise: no later than 3 days before Day 1

---

### 3.10 Micro-Customization Policy

- Hotel room category upgrade (may cost extra)
- Optional on-site activities (horse riding at Bromo, trolley ojek at Ijen)
- Dietary adjustment within operational limits

❌ Not offered:

- Significant route changes that alter primary destination sequence

---

### 3.11 Solo-Pricing Rule

Solo (1-pax) is bookable only where a `1 (solo)` tier exists in `wiki/products/packages-full-pricing.md`. Packages without a 1-pax row are not bookable solo via standard pricing.

**Solo-bookable packages** (1-pax tier exists):
- Surabaya origin: `ijen-bromo-madakaripura-3d2n`, `bromo-madakaripura-ijen-3d2n`, `ijen-bromo-madakaripura-4d3n`, `ijen-papuma-tumpak-sewu-bromo-4d3n`, `tumpak-sewu-bromo-ijen-4d3n`, `ijen-papuma-tumpak-sewu-bromo-5d4n`
- Bali origin: `bali/ijen-bromo-madakaripura-3d2n`, `bali/ijen-papuma-tumpak-sewu-bromo-4d3n`
- Student: 4 of 6 packages have 1-pax tier

---

### 3.12 Tipping Rule

Tips and gratuities are an **explicit exclusion** per `jvto-policy-pack-v6.md` §Inclusions & Exclusions. Forbid "tips included" / "tipping covered" / "service charge included" wording on any page. Approved wording: "Tips and gratuities are excluded — guest discretion."

---

## Section 4: Approved / Forbidden Wording

*Normalized from brand-voice.md and SSOT §2_4 for direct implementation use.*

### 4.1 Forbidden Phrases (all content)

| Forbidden | Why | Approved alternative |
|---|---|---|
| "Blue Fire guaranteed" | Weather-dependent, cannot be promised | "Blue Fire is a natural phenomenon subject to weather and gas activity." |
| "100% Blue Fire visible" | Same | Same |
| "Ijen access rules can require a health certificate" (threshold-conditional framing — superseded 2026-07-06) | Screening is mandatory for every guest; BBKSDA sets the rule | "A health certificate is mandatory for every guest before Kawah Ijen crater entry, per BBKSDA SE.1658/KSA.9/2024." |
| "Required by JVTO" (for health screening) | Wrong — BBKSDA rule, JVTO coordinates | "JVTO coordinates the mandatory clinic workflow under BBKSDA SE.1658/KSA.9/2024." |
| "JVTO provides police escort" (unconditional) | Conditional on group size and approval | Approved police escort wording (§3.8) |
| "Flexible cancellation available" | Too vague — misleads on policy | State the 48h threshold explicitly |
| "Full refund" | Not cash — Travel Credit | "100% Travel Credit (non-expiring)" |
| "Rp 1.500.000" | Wrong format | "IDR 1,500,000/person" (commas, not dots) |
| "$120" / "EUR 150" | Wrong currency | IDR only for pricing |
| "World-class" / "best in class" | No citation | Cite specific evidence |
| "We care about your safety" | Show, don't say | Cite SPRIN, BBKSDA, HPWKI, Dr. Irwandanu |
| "Amazing experience" / "unforgettable journey" | Generic marketing | Evidence-led specifics |
| "Authentic Indonesia" | Vague | Specific destination facts |
| "Tips included" / "Tipping covered" | Tips are explicit exclusion per policy pack | "Tips and gratuities are excluded — guest discretion." |

### 4.2 Key Phrases (use often)

- "Tourist Police-led" / "Police-led" / "Active Tourist Police officer (Ditpamobvit East Java)"
- "100% private — no shared groups"
- "Licensed operator, NIB 1102230032918"
- "Health-screening coordination" (not "mandatory screening")
- "Verifiable credentials" / "checkable at [URL]"
- "Plan-B framework" (for weather/closure scenarios)
- "All-inclusive — no surprise local payments"
- "Read the Rulebook Before You Book"
- "Gas masks provided by JVTO"
- "Bromo 4WD jeep included"

### 4.3 Founder Naming Convention

| Context | Use |
|---|---|
| Legal / formal | Agung Sambuko |
| Guest-facing / operational | Mr. Sam |
| Press / police rank | Bripka Agung Sambuko |
| E-E-A-T schema `jobTitle` | "Active Tourist Police Officer, Ditpamobvit East Java" |

### 4.4 Price Format

- Format: `IDR X,XXX,XXX/person` (comma thousand separators, no dots)
- Currency: IDR only. Never USD, EUR, AUD.
- Suffix: `/person` always specified.

### 4.5 Content Register Guide

**Style A** (wiki, schema, FAQ, AEO, /verify-jvto): Dense, fact-led, citation-first. Example: "JVTO is led by Bripka Agung Sambuko, an active officer of the Indonesian Tourist Police (Ditpamobvit East Java). NIB 1102230032918 verifies operational legality."

**Style B** (homepage, Why JVTO, marketing): Founder-as-protagonist, "we" voice, concrete promises. Example: "Mr. Sam is a Tourist Police officer first, tour operator second. That order matters."

## Section 6: Open Implementation Gaps

*Do not fix here — flag for owner action. Register as known debt.*

### GAP-01 — Google Maps review count drift (RESOLVED 2026-06-01)

- `output/website/HANDOFF.md`: was `Google Maps: 4.90 / 92 reviews` — **fixed to `4.9 / 123 reviews`**.
- `wiki/credentials/trust-signals.md §Schema Canonical Values`: was cross-platform total 164 (51+92+21) — **fixed to 195 (51+123+21, verified 2026-05-26 via API)**.
- `output/website/schema/homepage-organization-schema.json`: was `reviewCount: 164` — **regenerated to `reviewCount: 195`**.
- Receipt updated in `homepage-organization-schema.receipt.md`.
- **Status**: closed in-repo per source authority (trust-signals.md §Live Review Platforms).
- **2026-06-03 follow-up**: secondary mentions the 2026-06-01 pass missed were reconciled — `website/copy-bank.md`, `reviews/trustpilot-compilation.md`, `seo/competitors.md` (164→195), `output/website/aeo/why-jvto.md`, `pages/{bali,surabaya}-landing.md`, and `raw/_manifest/evidence-registry.yml` E010 (→ `trust-bundle/claims.json` regenerated via `compile_trust.py`, F1–F8 pass). No active 92/164 review claim remains; `db-export-2026-05` + `seo-audit-2026-05` retain point-in-time snapshot values by design.

### GAP-02 — IDR 3,350,000 price anomaly (RESOLVED 2026-06-01)

- `output/website/booking-platform-analysis.md` flagged IDR 3,350,000 displayed on self-checkout for an unspecified package.
- Per `packages-full-pricing.md`: `bali/bromo-ijen-3d2n` 6–7 pax tier = **IDR 3,350,000 exact canonical match**.
- **Status**: not an anomaly — canonical price. Closed per source authority.

### GAP-03 — Terms checkbox content (Instant Book Step 15)

- The self-checkout Terms checkbox must display JVTO Travel Credit policy text (≥48h = 100% Travel Credit; <48h forfeited).
- Current state: not confirmed whether the checkbox shows this policy or a generic placeholder.
- **Action**: Sam to audit the live checkout Terms checkbox text.

### GAP-04 — Health screening data collection missing from self-checkout

- The Instant Book self-checkout flow (Steps 1–18) has no health screening trigger.
- For Ijen-relevant packages, health screening must be coordinated pre-hike — currently handled post-booking via WhatsApp.
- This is acceptable operationally but the self-checkout UX should inform guests.
- **Action**: Add a health screening notice on the booking confirmation or in the Ijen package page copy.

### GAP-05 — Homepage Google Maps review count (RESOLVED in-repo 2026-06-02)

- In-repo page copy `output/website/pages/homepage.md` fixed `92 → 123` (verified 2026-05-26 via API), commit `63ab1eb`.
- **Status**: closed in-repo per source authority (trust-signals.md §Live Review Platforms).
- **Remaining (EXECUTION-OUT-OF-SCOPE)**: the live jvto-web homepage H2 / trust badge must mirror `123` on next deploy — external surface, FLAG ONLY.

### GAP-06 — `bromo-ijen-status-today` page blocked

- Silo 3 SEO target. Needs a live PVMBG/BBKSDA status source.
- MAGMA Indonesia feed not accessible via automated fetch.
- **Action**: Identify alternative source or implement manual update workflow.

### GAP-07 — Add-on "Transport to Medewi" not in authorized packages list (RESOLVED 2026-06-01)

- Self-checkout shows "Transport to Medewi" add-on upsell.
- Per source authority, `wiki/products/packages-overview.md` is canonical add-on list. Add-on is NOT listed.
- **Status**: unauthorized per canonical source. Decision = remove from live checkout, OR source-of-truth maintainer adds it to packages-overview. Closed in repo.

## Section 7: Trust Signal Matrix (C1–C9 × Page Section)

*Which claims to surface on which page sections. Minimize — one page doesn't need all 9.*

| Tour pages (reviews) | C6 | Trustpilot 4.8/51 |
| /why-jvto | C1, C2, C3, C7 | Founder credentials, crew registry, policy pack |
| /verify-jvto | C5, C8, C9 | NIB/TDUP/HPWKI docs + press articles |
| Destination pages (Ijen) | C4, C1 | BBKSDA regulation + health screening protocol |
