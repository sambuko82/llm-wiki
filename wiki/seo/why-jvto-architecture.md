## Key Components

| Component | File | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `AuthorityShield` | `components/atomic/trust/AuthorityShield.tsx` | Sticky display: Police status + NIB — persistent trust signal |
| `ForensicGallery` | `components/atomic/trust/ForensicGallery.tsx` | Evidence viewer with filename, size, upload date, SHA-256 hash |
| `CrewCard` | `components/atomic/trust/CrewCard.tsx` | Dynamic profile card pulling crew data + linked review excerpts |
| `TrustNavigation` | `components/atomic/trust/TrustNavigation.tsx` | Sub-navigation for the full Why JVTO cluster |
| `SSOTRenderer` | (implied) | Renders /why-jvto hub from `why-jvto-ssot.json` — auto-updates on SSOT change |

## Data Architecture

```
/data/why-jvto-ssot.json      ← Knowledge graph (generated at build time)
/data/raw/crews.csv           ← Source: crew operational manifest
/data/raw/reviews.csv         ← Source: aggregated Trustpilot + Google reviews
```

Build scripts:
- `scripts/forensics/generate-hashes.ts` — calculates SHA-256 for all /proof files
- `scripts/forensics/build-ssot.ts` — stitches CSV + hashes → JSON

`lib/ssot/stitcher.ts` — maps Crew ↔ Reviews ↔ Evidence (three-way join logic)

---

## Evidence Asset Structure

```
/public/assets/proof/
  /legal/     ← NIB, TDUP, Tax IDs
              ← Naming: YYYY-MM-DD_TYPE_ID.pdf
  /police/    ← SPRIN POLPAR, SPRIN WAL-TRAVEL, KTA (redacted), uniform photos
  /history/   ← Booking.com 2015 award plaque scan, Stefan Loose pages
  /partners/  ← HPWKI, INDECON certificates
```

Anti-duplication rule: evidence PDFs stored **only** in /public/assets/proof/. All other pages reference by Asset ID, not path duplication.

---

## API Endpoint

`/api/verifiable-credentials/route.ts` — exposes SSOT JSON for 3rd-party validation (AI agents, B2B clients, OTA integrations).

---

## 6 Trust Pillars (Hub Dashboard)

1. Tourist Police Leadership
2. Legal Compliance (NIB, TDUP, PT status)
3. Medical Protocols (Ijen health screening — BBKSDA SE.1658)
4. Private & All-Inclusive Logistics
5. Historical Continuity (2015 → present, Booking.com + Stefan Loose)
6. Crew Competence (HPWKI-trained, review-verified)
