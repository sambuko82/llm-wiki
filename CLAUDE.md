## Frontmatter Conventions

Every wiki page starts with:

    ---
    type: destination|reviews|product|person|credential|website|source|overview|ops|seo|whatsapp|finance
    title: Human-readable title
    last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
    sources: [slug1, slug2]
    ---

## Workflow 1: Ingest

1. **Read** the source fully
2. **Discuss** key takeaways with user
3. **Write** wiki/sources/[slug].md — key facts, quotes, content angles
4. **Update** relevant domain pages (may touch 5-15 pages)
5. **Update** wiki/index.md
6. **Append** to wiki/log.md:

    ## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Source Title
    Pages updated: [list]. Key additions: [brief].

7. **Commit**: `git add -A && git commit -m "ingest | Source Title"`

## Workflow 2: Query

1. Read wiki/index.md to find relevant pages
2. Read identified pages
3. Synthesize with citations e.g. -> [[reviews/trustpilot-compilation]]
4. File back valuable answers as new pages in wiki/website/

## Workflow 3: Lint

1. Scan for contradictions — flag with > Contradiction with [[other-page]]
2. Find orphan pages (no inbound links)
3. Flag stale claims with > [stale?]
4. Identify gap pages — concepts without their own page
5. Suggest new sources to fill gaps

## Workflow 4: Typed Ingest

Before beginning Workflow 1, declare source type from [[ops/ingestion-profiles]].
The profile supplies type-specific extraction targets and the wiki pages most likely to need updating.

## Workflow 5: Compilation Profile

Before generating output, select a profile from [[ops/compilation-profiles]].
State "Use the [profile] profile" to activate it. Save result to output/ using
the profile's filename convention.

## Workflow 6: Health Check

Tiered audit procedure — see [[ops/health-checks]] for full checklists.
Triggers: "Run health check" (on-demand), "Run weekly health check",
"Run monthly health check". Append report to wiki/log.md after each run.

## Content Production Guidelines

- **Voice**: Direct, evidence-led. "Tourist Police officer" not "safety-focused guide."
- **Language**: English for tourist copy; Bahasa Indonesia fine for internal notes
- **Claims**: Always cite a wiki source. Never invent credentials or statistics.
- **AEO format**: Structure FAQ answers as direct, quotable statements
- **Trust signals**: NIB 1102230032918, POLPAR, BBKSDA, Trustpilot Excellent, Dr. Irwandanu SIP, founded 2015

## Cross-Reference Conventions

- Link wiki pages: [[folder/page-name]]
- In prose, use -> before links: -> [[destinations/kawah-ijen]]
- Always update wiki/index.md after changes

## Current Sprint

**Last completed:** Project-architecture phase — created `wiki/ops/transformation-map.md` (master domain→bundle pipeline map, output convention `output/<domain>/<bundle>/`, Trust Bundle marked DONE/do-not-reopen) and `wiki/ops/package-readiness-compiler-spec.md` (spec-only for NEXT wedge: 16-package slug list, 6 output files, 12 validation rules PKG-01–12, compiler architecture). Both merged to master (PR #2, merge 76b31c8). Also hardened `~/.claude/commands/session-close.md` (selective staging, pre-commit scope HARD GATE, project-agnostic, freshness guard).
**Completed date:** 2026-05-31
**Next task:** Build `scripts/compile_packages.py` per `wiki/ops/package-readiness-compiler-spec.md` §9 — TDD (unit per parser + each PKG rule, E2E happy-path + strict-fail), then first `--dry-run` → `gap-report.json`. AWAITING EXPLICIT APPROVAL before coding.
**Build status:** — wiki-only this session (docs/specs), no code.
**Open items:**
- **URGENT**: Homepage H2 "92 on Google Maps" stale — now 123. Fix in jvto-web (not Trust-Bundle-related).
- R065 gap #1: verify JVTO website Terms checkbox (Step 15) shows Travel Credit policy text.
- R065 gap #2: price anomaly IDR 3,350,000 vs SSOT — folds into Package Readiness gap-report (PKG-04 pricing); Sam to verify pax tier / discount.
- robots.txt Cloudflare/custom conflict — contradictory AI crawler directives.
- `bromo-ijen-status-today` page — Silo 3 SEO target; blocked on replacement live PVMBG status source.
- Geographic landing pages (/markets/singapore, /markets/malaysia) — need flight/logistics data.
- `yadnya-kasada-2026` — need Tengger calendar source.

**Resolved (do not reopen):** Trust Bundle v1 DONE — DEC-001/002/003 locked, CONF-001/002/003 resolved, F1–F8 pass, real compile succeeded, 7 JSON outputs pushed, jvto-web `/trust` integrated. DQ-001 (Stefan Loose), DQ-002 (Madakaripura height), DQ-003 (second NIB) all resolved via DEC locks. See `wiki/ops/transformation-map.md` §do-not-reopen.
