## Frontmatter Conventions

Every wiki page starts with:

    ---
    type: destination|reviews|product|person|credential|website|source|overview|ops|seo|whatsapp|finance
    title: Human-readable title
    last_updated: YYYY-MM-DD
    sources: [slug1, slug2]
    ---

---

## Workflow 1: Ingest

1. **Read** the source fully
2. **Discuss** key takeaways with user
3. **Write** wiki/sources/[slug].md — key facts, quotes, content angles
4. **Update** relevant domain pages (may touch 5-15 pages)
5. **Update** wiki/index.md
6. **Append** to wiki/log.md:

    ## [YYYY-MM-DD] ingest | Source Title
    Pages updated: [list]. Key additions: [brief].

7. **Commit**: `git add -A && git commit -m "ingest | Source Title"`

## Workflow 2: Query

1. Read wiki/index.md to find relevant pages
2. Read identified pages
3. Synthesize with citations e.g. -> [[reviews/trustpilot-compilation]]
4. File back valuable answers as new pages in wiki/website/

## Workflow 3: Lint

1. Scan for contradictions — flag with > Contradiction with [[other-page]]
2. Find orphan pages (no inbound links)
3. Flag stale claims with > [stale?]
4. Identify gap pages — concepts without their own page
5. Suggest new sources to fill gaps

## Workflow 4: Typed Ingest

Before beginning Workflow 1, declare source type from [[ops/ingestion-profiles]].
The profile supplies type-specific extraction targets and the wiki pages most likely to need updating.

## Workflow 5: Compilation Profile

Before generating output, select a profile from [[ops/compilation-profiles]].
State "Use the [profile] profile" to activate it. Save result to output/ using
the profile's filename convention.

## Workflow 6: Health Check

Tiered audit procedure — see [[ops/health-checks]] for full checklists.
Triggers: "Run health check" (on-demand), "Run weekly health check",
"Run monthly health check". Append report to wiki/log.md after each run.

## Content Production Guidelines

- **Voice**: Direct, evidence-led. "Tourist Police officer" not "safety-focused guide."
- **Language**: English for tourist copy; Bahasa Indonesia fine for internal notes
- **Claims**: Always cite a wiki source. Never invent credentials or statistics.
- **AEO format**: Structure FAQ answers as direct, quotable statements
- **Trust signals**: NIB 1102230032918, POLPAR, BBKSDA, Trustpilot Excellent, Dr. Irwandanu SIP, founded 2015

## Cross-Reference Conventions

- Link wiki pages: [[folder/page-name]]
- In prose, use -> before links: -> [[destinations/kawah-ijen]]
- Always update wiki/index.md after changes

## Current Sprint

**Last completed:** Domain restructure — wiki/ and output/ reorganized into domain-separated folders (website, whatsapp, seo, finance). 8 files wiki/content/→wiki/website/, 8 files wiki/ops/ split to wiki/seo/ + wiki/whatsapp/, output/ consolidated (schema/faq/aeo under output/website/). Finance domain created: rate-cards, package-costs, profit-analysis, custom-tour-builder (from raw/FINANCE/ data). 14 commits, 74 wiki pages, 147 output files.
**Completed date:** 2026-05-25
**Next task:** Validate finance/profit-analysis.md against known selling prices on website. Then expand Silo 3 thin wiki pages (permit-requirements-east-java, sulfur-mining-cultural-guide, best-time-to-visit expansion).
**Build status:** — no code changes (wiki/output only)
**Open items:**
- `bromo-ijen-status-today` page — Silo 3 SEO target; blocked on replacement live source for PVMBG status
- Stefan Loose year/ISBN — 2016 vs 2018 dispute; requires physical book check by Sam
- Madakaripura height — "tallest in Java" under reconciliation
- Second NIB 0220001393513 — verify on OSS portal (blocked on portal access)
- Geographic landing pages (/markets/singapore, /markets/malaysia) — need flight/logistics data
- `yadnya-kasada-2026` — need Tengger calendar source

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, invoke it via the Skill tool. When in doubt, invoke the skill.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas/brainstorming → invoke /office-hours
- Strategy/scope → invoke /plan-ceo-review
- Architecture → invoke /plan-eng-review
- Design system/plan review → invoke /design-consultation or /plan-design-review
- Full review pipeline → invoke /autoplan
- Bugs/errors → invoke /investigate
- QA/testing site behavior → invoke /qa or /qa-only
- Code review/diff check → invoke /review
- Visual polish → invoke /design-review
- Ship/deploy/PR → invoke /ship or /land-and-deploy
- Save progress → invoke /context-save
- Resume context → invoke /context-restore
